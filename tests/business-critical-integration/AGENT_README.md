# Business Critical Integration Tests - CI Push Notification Strategy

## Overview
This project implements push notification integration tests that work seamlessly in both local and CI environments.

## CI Push Notification Strategy

### Problem
- CI servers use macOS virtualization which doesn't provide device tokens
- Without device tokens, apps can't register for APNS push notifications
- This breaks push notification integration tests in CI

### Solution Implemented
1. **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects CI environment via environment variables
2. **Mock Device Token**: Generates fake device tokens for CI testing 
3. **Simulated Push Notifications**: Uses `xcrun simctl push` to send fake pushes to simulator
4. **Local Testing Unchanged**: Real APNS pushes continue to work locally

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- `AppDelegate+IntegrationTest.swift`: CI detection + mock device token generation
- `IntegrationTestBase.swift`: CI environment detection + simulated push capabilities
- `PushNotificationIntegrationTests.swift`: CI-aware push notification testing
- `run-tests.sh`: CI environment variable setup

### CI Environment Detection
- Checks for `CI=1`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `JENKINS_URL`, `BUILDKITE` environment variables
- Automatically enables mock mode when detected

### Mock Device Token Generation
- Generates realistic 32-byte hex string tokens in CI
- Simulates `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` callback
- Maintains full Iterable SDK registration flow

### Simulated Push Notifications
- Uses `xcrun simctl push` command with temporary `.apns` payload files
- Supports both standard and deep link push notifications
- Validates same notification handling logic as real pushes

## Usage

### Local Testing (Default)
```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```
- Uses real APNS push notifications
- Full end-to-end validation

### CI Testing
```bash
CI=1 ./scripts/run-tests.sh
```
- Uses mock device tokens
- Sends simulated push notifications
- Tests full push notification flow without network dependencies

## Push Notification Payloads

### Standard Push (CI)
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Integration Test",
      "body": "This is an integration test simple push"
    },
    "badge": 1,
    "sound": "default"
  },
  "itbl": {
    "campaignId": 12345,
    "templateId": 67890,
    "isGhostPush": false
  }
}
```

### Deep Link Push (CI)
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Deep Link Test", 
      "body": "This is a deep link push notification test"
    },
    "badge": 1,
    "sound": "default"
  },
  "itbl": {
    "campaignId": 12346,
    "templateId": 67891,
    "isGhostPush": false,
    "deepLinkURL": "tester://product?itemId=12345&category=shoes"
  }
}
```

## Screenshot Management

### Problem
- Screenshots were being saved to iOS simulator's Documents directory instead of project's screenshots folder
- Screenshots from test runs were not accessible for review or CI artifacts

### Solution
- Added `copy_screenshots_from_simulator()` function to run-tests.sh
- Automatically copies screenshots from simulator Documents to project screenshots folder after tests complete
- Clears previous screenshots from project directory before copying new ones
- Cleans up simulator screenshots after successful copy

### Implementation
- Parses screenshot directory path directly from test log files in reports directory
- Uses `find` to locate most recent `.log` file for parsing
- Falls back to searching simulator directories if log parsing fails
- Integrates into test completion flow before cleanup
- Fixed xcresulttool deprecation warning by adding `--legacy` flag

## Test Artifacts Organization

### Directory Structure
- **üìÅ reports/**: XCTest result bundles (.xcresult) and test reports (.log files for screenshot parsing)
- **üìÅ logs/**: Complete test execution logs with full output 
- **üìÅ screenshots/**: Test screenshots automatically copied from simulator
- **üìÅ scripts/**: Test execution and utility scripts

### File Naming Convention
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Test class name converted to lowercase
- Examples:
  - `pushnotificationintegrationtests-20250829-131349.xcresult`
  - `pushnotificationintegrationtests-20250829-131349.log`

## Benefits
